AutosRus' newest prototype, MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. Jeremy has been asked to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
